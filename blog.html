                           <br> <h5 class="name-title">Summer</h5>  <br>
                              <p>One year later, and I'm sitting in the same spot with the same person. Even the ripped paper heart cutouts are scattered across my lap, but this time Aiden Crawford won't be walking through the doors of Starlight Karaoke.</p>
                              <p>“Are you feeling better?” I look up from my lap to Kian, who throws me a pitiful look, like I'm a stray he found in the gutter.</p>
                              <p>“Weirdly, I feel exactly like I did last year.”</p>
                              <p>“Bruised and vengeful?”</p>
                              <p>I glare at him. The reminder of our disastrous Valentine's Day blind date that ended with me falling on my ass isn't a fond memory. “Violent.”</p>
                              <p>Kian's chuckle is short because he sounds more terrified than anything. But I can't bother threatening to stab him with my heel this time because my mind
                                is on the boy playing hockey miles away. The Toronto Thunder had a game today of all days—clearly, the NHL has it out for girlfriends. When I called my mom,
                                practically whining about being a loner for a 22nd consecutive Valentine's in a row, she said to get used to it because she's spent about two valentines with
                                my dad when he was playing. Not very encouraging words. Especially when I haven't seen Aiden since his birthday, and when I offered to fly out for today, he was keen on reminding
                                me that I have classes I can't afford to miss. He's right, but I'm still annoyed.</p>
                            <p>We FaceTimed last night and this morning, but when he tried calling me before his game, I missed it while I was at my internship. The flowers that were delivered to my dorm made me cry so hard, the delivery guy thought I needed an ambulance.</p>
                            <p><em>Will you be my Valentine?</em></p>
                            <p>My boyfriend is sickeningly sweet, and the flowers were not the last of his surprises. He got me a bouquet of romance books delivered by Sampson, who was more than happy to stop by the dorm to annoy Amara before we all went out for a breakfast reservation Aiden made for all of us.
                                Now, the funeral wreath I sent him as a joke and a rare edition of one of his favorite books seems like the bare minimum.</p>
                            <p>“Can you at least try not to sulk?” Kian breaks me out of my thoughts.</p>
                            <p>“You forced me to come here. I didn't promise you a good time.”</p>
                            <p>“It was better than finding you laying in his bed with his hoodie on. That was creepy.”</p>
                            <p>“It makes me feel closer to him. You wouldn't know what long distance is like.”</p>
                            <p>He smiles, probably thinking about his happy little love life. The dichotomy of last year's Valentine's Day is ironic. Laughable even.</p>
                            <p>“Why did you even want to come here? You could have perfectly good plans.”</p>
                            <p>“Oh, I do.” He wiggles his brows. “But that's for later. Right now, I want to spend time with you.”</p>
                            <p>“I swear to god if you drag me up for that game, you will not be forgiven this time.”</p>
                            <p>“No promises,” he jokes. “But if you stop pouting for a second, you have to admit this is better than moping in an empty house.”</p>
                            <p>I guess he's kind of right. Everyone had plans today, and I mean everyone. Down to Cole and Sebastian. It was just me and the depressing vinyl I had playing in Kian's room before he had enough of me.</p>
                            <p>When Starlight's annual blind date game starts, I feel gloomier than before, and to not rain on Kian's perfectly good night, I grab my purse. “Can you just take me back to the house?”</p>
                            <p>He checks his watch, takes out his phone, hesitates, then nods. Not a single word leaves him, and even the ride back to the house is quiet. No music, just the sound of Kian humming some love song.</p>
                            <p>When he unlocks the door, he looks nervous but plays it off when he glances at his watch and stops at the threshold. “Don't mean to ditch you, but...”</p>
                            <p>“Go already.” I push. “I bet you have a grand gesture planned.”</p>
                            <p>“Very grand.” He gazes down at his crotch like an idiot.</p>
                            <p>I screw my nose, not missing the stupid joke as he shuffles back down the steps and into his car. When I get inside, it's still as dark and gloomy as I left it. Okay, well, maybe not gloomy, that might just be me.</p>
                            <p>Hoping to combat the misery clouding over me, I grab a slice of cake from the fridge and head over to the couch to watch the game highlights. The camera operators deserve a raise for all the close-ups of Aiden, and I wish I could
                                see him live. I'm barely paying attention when my phone buzzes with a text from my dad, sending me a clip of Aiden's overtime win. I'm sure he knows about my woe-is-me attitude, and this must be his way of checking on me.</p>
                            <p>After replying, I'm on standby for Aiden's call so I don't text Amara, but she has her plans anyway, so I won't drag her down with me. Instead, I try to distract myself with a long bath, and when I head to his room, I decide
                                to torture Aiden just a little by slipping into a tiny piece of red lingerie and sending him a few pictures. The messages don't deliver because his phone must be off after the game, so I head to bed.</p>

           <br> <h5 class="name-title">Aiden</h5> </br>
           <p>Slipping into the Uber, I try my best not to annoy the driver by telling him to drive faster. My phone is dead, and the night is slipping away as we drive through the city. I plug my phone into the charging port of the car and impatiently wait for it to turn on.</p>
           <p>My girl is alone on Valentine's, and I didn't get to talk to her as long as I wanted today. The funeral wreath she had delivered to our apartment had Eli laughing at me, but the note in the special edition book made my chest hurt. I know she got everything I sent her,
            but I feel desperate to hear her voice or just see her pretty face again. I debated whether I should run to the house, but that's post-game adrenaline talking because I would be in agony tomorrow.</p>
            <p>“Oh shit, you're Aiden Crawford.” The driver's wide eyes stare back at me, not paying much attention to the road. Fortunately, it's so late there are barely any cars out. "I was listening to the game; your OT was the only reason we won tonight."</p>
            <p>“Thanks, man.”</p>
            <p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
            <p>“Just back home for the night.”</p>
            <p>He smiles at me through the rear-view mirror. “Ah, I see. Can't leave the girlfriend alone on Valentine's.”</p>
            <p>I laugh, nodding just as my phone finally powers on. Scrolling through the missed calls and texts, I go straight to the one from Summer, and when I open it, I groan so loud the car jerks to a stop.</p>
            <p>“Everything okay?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, sorry. Continue.”</p>
            <p>My eyes drop back to the picture that is pure torture. Her red lingerie melts onto her figure, outlining her curves and every inch of her soft, kissable skin. Biting my fist, I swipe through the three images, staring at them for the entire ride home.</p>
            <p>The driver asks for an autograph, and I do a shitty signature before barrelling up the steps of the hockey house. Kian kept Summer occupied for a while, but I couldn't let him miss his own date, though he didn't seem to mind.</p>
            <p>Racing upstairs, my heart stutters when I don't see her in my room. The pillow on my side of the bed is gone, but the bed isn't slept in. I check the washroom, then the other bedrooms, but there's no sign of Summer anywhere.</p>
            <p>When I'm close to ripping apart the house, I notice the TV in the living room illuminating my sleeping girlfriend, and the breath that escapes me almost knocks me to my knees. Highlights from tonight's game play, and I can't help but smile when I approach her sleeping figure. Kneeling by the couch, I tuck her silky hair behind her ear, the peach scent alone making my endorphins flood my system, as I leave light kisses on her forehead. She barely stirs, clutching the pillow and throw blanket.
                </p>
            <p>“Happy Valentine's Day, baby,” I whisper, caressing her soft skin, and finally, sleepy brown eyes blink open.</p>
            <p>She freezes, making a surprised sound before lunging at me to wrap her arms around my neck, words muffled into my shoulder. “I swear if this is a dream, I'm going to be so pissed at you.”</p>
            <p>“You'd be mad at me because of a dream?”</p>
            <p>“So mad.” She burrows in the crook of my neck, then finally when she faces me again, I kiss her soft, pillowy lips, and she immediately complies. “How are you here? I just watched you on TV.”</p>
            <p>“Got on a flight after the game.”</p>
            <p>“Why?”</p>
            <p>“Why do you think, Summer? I missed you.”</p>
            <p>“You're probably exhausted,” she says, moving her hand to stroke my cheek, thumb gliding along my bottom lip.</p>
            <p>“Never when I'm with you,” I say. “Why are you sleeping here?”</p>
            <p>She shrugs, playing with my overgrown hair. I'm in desperate need of a haircut, and Summer's been telling me to get one too, but I know she doesn't mind pulling it.</p>
            <p>“Is that my pillow?”</p>
            <p>“It smells like you.”</p>
            <p>God, she's fucking adorable. “C'mon, we're going to bed.”</p>
            <p>I pull her up, and she clutches the pillow against her chest as she burrows into me. When I place her on our bed, she doesn't let go of the pillow, so I pull it away, knowing what I'm going to find underneath.
                Her cheeks tint pink when I groan at her outfit. The silky robe slips away to show the red lingerie. “There is no chance I'd miss seeing this.”</p>
            <p>“There's a surprise for you on the back.”</p>
            <p>When I try to flip her over, her foot presses against my chest, stopping me. “Nuh-uh, I gotta see you strip first.”</p>
            <p>What Summer wants, Summer gets. “Whatever you say, baby.”</p>
            <p>Making quick work of shedding my clothes, I leave on my boxers to tease her. She doesn't protest when I flip her over this time, only to find my number twenty-two embroidered on the back of the waistband, right above her perfect ass.</p>
            <p>“Does that mean I can't tear these off?”</p>
            <p>Summer glares, but this time she lets me slide off her panties, kissing my way down her legs, then when I yank her forward her palms push at my chest until I'm laying flat on my back.</p>
            <p>Heat clouds behind her eyes. “You're getting rewarded tonight, Crawford.” She takes time slipping the straps of her bra low, low, low until her breasts are bare.</p>
            <p>I can't stop touching her. “Eating your pussy is my reward.”</p>
            <p>“Then this is mine,” she says, hooking her fingers in the waistband of my boxers to slide them off, then moving between my legs. I'm already hard as stone when she swirls her tongue along the tip. “You played so well,” she purrs and I might pass out. “I love watching you on the ice.”</p>
            <p>The only thing I can do is nod as she wraps her lips around me, trapping my breath somewhere in my lungs with the hot suction. That only makes her hum against my cock, and I jerk.</p>
            <p>Those big brown eyes look up at me, so innocent after what she just did to me—what she's still doing to me. I stop her with a hand in her hair, forcing her to look up at me from under those long lashes. “Not yet, I want to come inside you.”</p>
            <p>Her eyes brighten, and she pulls away, a string of saliva pulling from my cock to her lips. I drag her forward to kiss me, and keep moving her until her pussy is in my face.</p>
            <p>“You smell so fucking good,” I say as she lowers onto my mouth. She gasps, her hands clutching the headboard. “Taste even better.”</p>
            <p>I keep her open with my thumb as my tongue dives into her sweetness. She's soaking wet, and her moans send me over the edge again. I slip a finger inside, and a loud moan escapes her. Just before she
                can exhale again, I pull her down my body and slide into her so perfectly her teeth sink into my shoulder. She grinds against me, the sound of her slick arousal filling the room. I take her nipple into my
                mouth, and she screams so loud, I'm sure the neighbors can hear us. Though, that's not something we've ever worried about. I slide a hand down her stomach to her core, and she moves back to kiss me, her low moans filling my mouth.</p>
            <p>It hits me so hard I see a flash of white before she comes too. I ride out her orgasm and lay back with her on top of me.</p>
            <p>“I can't get enough of you.”</p>
            <p>“I love you," she says, kissing me again, face flushed and skin warm. “How long do I have you?”</p>
            <p>“Forever.” I grin.</p>
            <p>I can see that somber look taking over her features even when she rolls her eyes. The same one she gets every time I have to leave.</p>
            <p>“I gotta get on my flight by six a.m.” It feels so good to hold her, I don't know how I've lasted any amount of time without her. I love hockey, but I love her more, and having to leave her so often never feels right. Though, if I told her I'll retire and stay here with her, she'd smack
                me upside the head because if we don't win a Stanley cup, I'll lose the bet I made with her dad years ago. “Come with me.”</p>
            <p>It's ridiculous, but I still wait for an answer. “Babe, I have classes all week.”</p>
            <p>“Then say the word, and I'll stay.”</p>
            <p>“Mhm. Have fun explaining to Coach you missed a game to stay in bed with me.”</p>
            <p>“He's seen you; he'd understand.”</p>
            <p>She smacks my chest, and I catch her hand to kiss her knuckles before pulling the comforter over both of us. We don't get much sleep that night, but it's worth every second because as long as I have her, nothing feels incomplete.</p>
