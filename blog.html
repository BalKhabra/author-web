                           <br> <h5 class="name-title">Summer</h5>  <br>
                              <p>Being an NHL wife means having your husband miss cute holidays because he’s working.</p>
                              <p>It’s Valentine's Day, and it feels like nothing’s changed; I still want to stab that floating
                                baby with his own arrow. The Toronto Thunder have a game today of all days—clearly, the NHL 
                                 has it out for the wives and girlfriends—so Aiden can’t make it home. When I called my mom whining
                                 about being a loner for another Valentine’s, she said I’d better get used to it because she spent
                                 most of her Valentine’s alone when my dad was playing. Not the words I wanted to hear. </p>
                                 <p>Aiden called me before his game, but I missed it while I was in the shower. His calls this morning
                                    went to voicemail because I was at my internship. The flowers that were delivered to the house made me
                                    cry so hard, the delivery guy thought I needed an ambulance. </p>
                                   <p> <em>Will you be my Valentine?</em></p>
                                   <p>My husband is sickeningly sweet, and the flowers were not the last of his surprises. He got me a
                                    spa day, much needed because I’ve been traveling for work these past few weeks. He had a private
                                    chef come to cook in our kitchen too, and after she left, I sat at the dinner table with candlelight,
                                    eating the best food I’ve ever had, all alone.</p>
                                    <p>Hoping to combat the misery clouding my mood, I take my plate over to the couch and watch the game.
                                        The close-ups of Aiden make me want to tip the cameraman, and make me wish I could be there with him,
                                        but this is what happens when our schedules clash.</p>
                                    <p>I’m barely paying attention to the game when my phone buzzes with a text from the groupchat with my dad
                                        and Kian. My dad is confident that Aiden’s going to win us the game, and he does, with a breakaway in overtime.
                                        Which means when my phone is blowing up, it’s Kian complaining about losing the bet. </p>
                                    <p>Apparently, Kian had more faith in the opposing team, but I know he only said that to annoy <em>the</em> Lukas Preston.
                                        Now, he has to mow my dad’s lawn—acres and acres of it—the next time he’s in Toronto.</p>
                                    <p>Muting the chat, I’m on standby for Aiden’s call for the next few hours. I don’t call Amara because she has her own plans and
                                        I won’t drag her down with me. Instead, I try to distract myself with a long bath, and when I head to our room, I decide to torture Aiden,
                                        just a little, by slipping into a tiny piece of red lingerie and sending him a few pictures. The messages don’t get delivered because his
                                        phone must be off after the game, so I head to his side of the bed and try to sleep.
                                    </p>

           <br> <h5 class="name-title">Aiden</h5> </br>
            <p>	Slipping into the Uber, I try my best not to annoy the driver by telling him to drive faster. My phone is dead, and the night is slipping away
                as we drive through the city. I plug my phone into the charging port of the car and impatiently wait for it to turn on. </p>
            <p>	My girl is alone on Valentine’s, and I didn’t get to talk to her today. I know she got everything I sent her, but I feel desperate to
                hear her voice or just see her pretty face. I debated whether I should run home, but that’s post-game adrenaline talking because I would be in agony tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>	“Oh shit, you’re Aiden Crawford.” The driver’s wide eyes stare back at me, not paying much attention to the road. Fortunately, it’s so late there are
                barely any cars out. “I was listening to the game, your OT was the only reason we won tonight.”
            </p>
            <p>“Thanks, man.”</p>
            <p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
            <p>“Just back home for the night.”</p>
            <p>He smiles at me through the rear-view mirror. “Ah I see. Can’t leave the wife alone on Valentine’s.”</p>
            <p>I laugh, nodding just as my phone finally powers on. Scrolling through the missed calls and texts, I go straight to the one from Summer,
                and when I open it, I groan so loud the car jerks to a stop.</p>
                <p>	“Everything okay?"</p>
                <p>	“Yeah, sorry. Continue.”</p>
                <p>My eyes drop back to the picture that is pure torture. Her red lingerie melts onto her figure, outlining her curves and every inch of her soft,
                    kissable skin. Biting my fist, I swipe through the three images, staring at them for the entire ride home.</p>
                <p>	The driver asks for an autograph and I do a shitty signature before barrelling into the house through the garage.</p>
                <p>	Heading upstairs my heart stutters when I don’t see her in our room. The pillow on my side of the bed is gone, but
                    the bed isn’t slept in. I check the washroom, then the spare bedrooms but there’s no sign of Summer anywhere. </p>
                <p>	When I’m close to ripping apart the house, I notice the TV in our living room illuminating my sleeping wife, and the breath
                    that escapes me almost knocks me to my knees. Highlights from tonight’s game play and I can’t help but smile when I approach her
                    sleeping figure.</p>
                <p>	Kneeling by the couch, I tuck her silky hair behind her ear, the peach scent alone making my endorphins flood my system,
                    as I leave light kisses on her forehead. She barely stirs, clutching the pillow and throw blanket, so I continue caressing
                    her soft skin, nudging her awake.</p>
                <p>	“Happy Valentine’s Day, baby,” I whisper and sleepy brown eyes blink open.</p>
                <p>She freezes, making a surprised sound before lunging at me to wrap her arms around my neck, words muffled into my shoulder.
                    “I swear if this is a dream, I’m going to be so pissed at you.”</p>
                <p>“You’d be mad at me because of a dream?”</p>
                <p>	She burrows in the crook of my neck, then finally when she faces me again, I kiss her soft, pillowy lips, and she immediately complies. “How are you here? I just watched you on TV.”</p>
                <p>“Got on a plane after the game.”</p>
                <p>“Why?”</p>
                <p>“Why do you think, Summer? I missed you.”</p>
                <p>“You’re probably exhausted,” she says, moving her hand to stroke my cheek, thumb gliding along my bottom lip.</p>
                <p>“Never when I’m with you,” I say. “Why are you sleeping here?”</p>
                <p>She shrugs, playing with my overgrown hair. I’m in desperate need of a haircut and Summer’s been telling me to get one too, but I know she doesn’t mind pulling it.</p>
                <p>“Is that my pillow?”</p>
                <p>“It smells like you.”</p>
                <p>God, she's fucking adorable. “C’mon, we’re going to bed.” </p>
                <p>I pull her up and she clutches the pillow against her chest as she burrows into me. When I place her on our bed she doesn’t
                    let go of the pillow, so I pull it away, knowing what I’m going to find underneath.</p>
                <p>Her cheeks tint pink when I groan at her outfit. “There is no chance I’d miss seeing this.”</p>
                <p>“There’s a surprise for you on the back.”</p>
                <p>When I try to flip her over, her foot presses against my chest, stopping me. “Nuh-uh, I gotta see you strip first.”</p>
                <p>What Summer wants, Summer gets.  “Whatever you say, baby.”</p>
                <p>Making quick work of shedding my clothes, I leave on my boxers to tease her. She doesn’t protest when I flip her over this time, only to find <em>Mrs. Crawford</em>
                    embroidered on the back of the waistband, right above her perfect ass. </p>
                    <p>“Does that mean I can’t tear these off?”</p>
                <p>Summer glares, but this time she lets me slide off her panties, kissing my way down her legs, then when I yank her
                    forward her palms push at my chest until I’m laying flat on my back.</p>
                <p>Heat clouds behind her eyes. “You’re getting rewarded tonight, Mr. Crawford.” She takes time slipping the straps of her bra low, low, low until her breasts are bare.</p>
                <p>I can’t stop touching her. “Eating your pussy is my reward.”</p>
                <p>“Then this is mine,” she says, hooking her fingers in the waistband of my boxers to slide them off, then moving between my legs. I’m already hard as stone when she swirls her tongue along the tip. “You played so well,” she purrs and I might pass out.
                    “I love watching you on the ice.”</p>
            <p>The only thing I can do is nod as she wraps her lips around me, trapping my breath somewhere in my lungs with the hot suction. That only makes her hum against my cock and I jerk.</p>
            <p>Those big brown eyes look up at me, so fucking innocent after what she just did to me—what she’s still doing to me. I stop her with a hand in her hair, forcing her to look up at me from under those long lashes. “Not yet, I want to come inside you.”</p>
            <p>Her eyes brighten and she pulls away, a string of saliva pulling from my cock to her lips. I drag her forward to kiss me, and keep moving her until her pussy is in my face. </p>
            <p>“You smell so fucking good," I say as she lowers onto my mouth. She gasps, her hands clutching the headboard. “Taste even better.”</p>
            <p>I keep her open with my thumb as my tongue dives into her sweetness. She’s soaking wet and her moans send me over the edge again. I slip a finger inside and a loud moan escapes her. Just before she can exhale again
                I pull her down my body and slide into her so perfectly her teeth sink into my shoulder. I move her up and down my cock, the sound of her slick arousal filling the room. I take her nipple into my mouth and she screams so loud,
                I’m sure the neighbors can hear us. Though, that’s not something we’ve ever worried about. Not in college and not now. I take the other in my hand and massage it, my thumb brushing over the hardened peak. I bring my hand down
                her stomach to her clit and she moves back to kiss me.</p>
            <p>Right then, it hits me so hard I see a flash of white before she comes too. I ride out her orgasm and lay back with her on top of me. “I can’t get enough of you.”</p>
            <p>“I love you,” she says, kissing me again, face flushed and skin warm. “How long do I have you?”</p>
            <p>“Forever.” I grin.</p>
            <p>I can see that somber look taking over her features even when she rolls her eyes. The same one she gets every time I have to leave for a game.</p>
            <p>“I gotta get on my flight by six a.m., but I’ll be back on Sunday.” It feels so good to hold her, I don’t know how I’ve
                lasted any amount of time without her. I love hockey, but I love her more and having to leave her so often never feels right.
                Though, if I told her I’ll retire and stay here with her, she’d smack me upside the head because if we don’t win a Stanley cup,
                I’ll lose the bet I made with her dad years ago. “Come with me.”</p>
            <p>It’s ridiculous, but I still wait for an answer. “Babe, I have clients scheduled all week.”</p>
            <p>“Then say the word, and I’ll stay.”</p>
